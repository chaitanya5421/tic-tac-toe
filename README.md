# tic-tac-toe
This is a simple game of tic tac toe that I created using javascript skills.
Most of the games I have seen online require two players, 
and I wanted to try creating a game where one player plays against the computer.

The project is organized into multiple steps, each in their own branch:

- Step 1: drawing the grid lines
- Step 2: drawing the X's and O's
- Step 3: detecting and showing a win or a tie
- Step 4: adding a computer player
- Final: final solution branch
